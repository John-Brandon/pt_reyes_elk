# Point Reyes Elk Counts
Abundance estimates for elk herds at Point Reyes National Seashore. Annual estimates are compiled, including counts by sex and age by individual herd (whn available) in `./data/abundance.xlsx`
The data file contains references for each annual estimate. I have compiled these data myself, to make them publically available to interested parties including the general public and the scientific community. The compiled estimates are missing some years, including more recent years since 2018, where I have not yet been able to find publically available data to fill in gaps. If you have knowledge of these missing data that can be filled-in to make this dataset as complete as possible, please feel free to collaborate by submitting a pull request to update the database.
