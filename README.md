Point Reyes Elk Abundance Estimates: 1978 to Present
================
John R. Brandon, PhD
2025-02-01

## Summary

Annual abundance estimates for individual elk herds at Point Reyes
National Seashore are compiled here. The estimates include, when
available since 1978 (the first year of elk reintroduction), counts by
sex and age-class each year. The estimates are tabled at the bottom of
this page, and are also provided in the file: `./data/abundance.xlsx`

The data file contains the corresponding reference for each annual
estimate. I have transcribed and compiled these estimates myself from
publicly available sources (e.g., Howell et al. 2002; Bernot and Press
2018). This has been done in an effort to provide a compendium of the
entire time series of abundance estimates in a single machine readable
file to interested parties.

These estimates are of interest with respect to elk population dynamics
and trends at Point Reyes National Seashore and elsewhere. Likewise they
are of interest to the public to inform comment and feedback in the
context of the National Park Service’s (NPS) historic and proposed
management plans and actions (e.g., fencing and other forms of elk
population control) that affect these herds, including NPS’s cooperative
agreements with tribal and state authorities in California. To my
knowledge, the time series of abundance estimates has not been compiled
into a single data file that is publicly available to facilitate review
and analysis. Thus, interested parties will include the scientific
community, educators, and the general public.

The compiled estimates are missing some years, including more recent
years since 2018, where I have not yet been able to find publicly
available information to fill certain gaps. If you have knowledge of
missing estimates that should be included (with a citable reference), to
make this dataset as complete and informative as possible, please feel
free to collaborate by opening a new “issue” for this repository, or by
submitting a pull request to update the data file.

These transcribed estimates are provided as is, with no warranty. It is
the end-user’s responsibility to ensure that the records have been
transcribed correctly. If a transcription error is found, please suggest
a correction through one of the two approaches noted above (i.e., open
an issue or submit a pull request).

Lastly, I am not an elk biologist. I was raised in Central California,
and have a PhD in fisheries stock assessment, wildlife population
dynamics modeling, and quantitative management strategy evaluation from
the University of Washington. I am a Senior Biometrician (environmental
consultant) at ICF International, where I work with state and federal
agencies, tribes, and industry on natural resource management issues
(none related to elk). I am also a Federally appointed member of the
Pacific Scientific Review Group established under the Marine Mammal
Protection Act.

Any detailed questions on the underlying survey data and methodology
upon which these elk abundance estimates have been derived should be
pointed to the appropriate contact(s) at the National Park Service.
