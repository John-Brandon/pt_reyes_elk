Point Reyes Elk Abundance Estimates: 1978 to Present
================
John R. Brandon, PhD

## Summary

Annual abundance estimates for individual elk herds at Point Reyes
National Seashore are compiled here. The estimates include, when
available since 1978 (the first year of elk reintroduction), counts by
sex and age-class each year. The estimates are tabled at the bottom of
this page, and are also provided in the file: `./data/abundance.xlsx`

The data file contains the corresponding reference for each annual
estimate. I have transcribed and compiled these estimates myself from
publicly available sources (e.g., Howell et al. 2002; Bernot and Press
2018). This has been done in an effort to provide a compendium of the
entire time series of abundance estimates in a single machine readable
file to interested parties.

These estimates are of interest with respect to elk population dynamics
and trends at Point Reyes National Seashore and elsewhere. Likewise the
data file is of interest to the public in the context of the National
Park Service’s (NPS) existing and proposed management plans and actions
(e.g., fencing and other forms of elk population control) that affect
these herds, including NPS’s cooperative agreements with tribal and
state authorities in California. To my knowledge, the time series of
abundance estimates has not been compiled into a single data file that
is publicly available to facilitate independent review and analysis.
Thus, interested parties will include the scientific community,
educators, Indian nation (in particular the Federated Tribes of Graton
Rancheria), the California Department and Commission of Fish and Game,
and the general public.

The compiled estimates are missing some years; including more recent
years since 2018, where I have not yet been able to find publicly
available information to fill certain gaps. If you have knowledge of
missing estimates that should be included (with a citable reference), to
make this dataset as complete and informative as possible, please feel
free to collaborate by opening a new “issue” for this repository, or by
submitting a pull request to update the data file.

These transcribed estimates are provided as is, with no warranty. It is
the end-user’s responsibility to ensure that the records have been
transcribed correctly. If a transcription error is found, please suggest
a correction through one of the two approaches noted above (i.e., open
an issue or submit a pull request).

Lastly, I am not an elk biologist. Any questions on the underlying
survey methodology or the ecology of these elk should be pointed to the
appropriate contact(s) at the National Park Service. At the time of
writing, the contact listed for elk surveys on the National Park Service
website is: <Dave_Press@nps.gov>

About me: I was raised in California, and have a PhD in fisheries stock
assessment and wildlife population dynamics modeling from the University
of Washington. I am a Senior Biometrician (environmental consultant) at
ICF International, where I work on natural resource management issues
with state and federal agencies, industry, and tribes. I am also a
federally appointed member of the Pacific Scientific Review Group
established to provide independent scientific expertise to the U.S.
National Marine Fisheries and Fish and Wildlife Services under the
Marine Mammal Protection Act.
