# Point Reyes Elk Counts
Abundance estimates for elk herds at Point Reyes National Seashore. Annual estimates are compiled, including counts by sex and age by individual herd (whn available) in `./data/abundance.xlsx`

The data file contains references for each annual estimate. I have transcribed and compiled these data myself from publically available sources. This has been done to make all abundance data (1978â€“Present) publically available to interested parties with respect to elk population dynamics and the National Park Service's management plans that may affect these herds, and recovering elk abundance levels in the state of California. Such parties may include the scientific community, educators and the general public. 

The compiled estimates are missing some years, including more recent years since 2018, where I have not yet been able to find publically available data to fill in those gaps. If you have knowledge of missing data that can be filled-in (with a citable reference), to make this dataset as complete and informative as possible, please feel free to collaborate by opening a new "issue" for this repository, or by submitting a pull request to update the database.

These transcribed estimates are provided as is, with no warranty. It is the end user's responsibility to ensure that records are transcribed correctly, and if transcription errors, please feel free to collaborate in any necessary correction through one of the two approaches noted above (e.g., submit a pull request).
